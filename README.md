# ðŸ‘¾ Arkade Wallet

Arkade Wallet is the entry-point to the Arkade ecosystemâ€”a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet delivered as a lightweight Progressive Web App (installable on mobile or desktop in seconds, no app-store gatekeepers). Built around the open-source ARK protocol, it speaks natively to any [arkd](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd) instance, letting you create, send, and receive Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs) for instant, off-chain pre-confirmations and batched, fee-efficient on-chain settlement.
