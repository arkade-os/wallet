# ðŸ‘¾ Arkade Wallet

Arkade Wallet is the entry-point to the Arkade ecosystemâ€”a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet delivered as a lightweight Progressive Web App (installable on mobile or desktop in seconds, no app-store gatekeepers). Built around the open-source ARK protocol, it speaks natively to any [arkd](https://github.com/arkade-os/arkd) instance, letting you create, send, and receive Virtual Transaction Outputs (VTXOs) for instant, off-chain pre-confirmations and batched, fee-efficient on-chain settlement.

### `pnpm run regtest`

Starts the regtest environment and sets up the arkd instance. Requires Docker to be installed and [Nigiri](https://nigiri.vulpem.com/) to be running.

### e2e tests

> note: e2e tests require a regtest environment to be running.
> `pnpm run regtest` to start and setup the regtest environment.

> note: e2e tests use playwright for ui testing, you may need to run
> `pnpm exec playwright install` once to download new browsers.

Run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e
```

Run the tests in interactive mode with:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e --ui
