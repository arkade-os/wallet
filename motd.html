As Baltic Honeybadger comes to an end, so does this demo and trial.
The feedback we have received from you has been incredible and we hope you liked what you saw. 
Please reach out if you would like to integrate Arkade into your business, we're here to help and guide.
We have disabled receiving funds in an attempt to gracefully offboard you off this demo instance. If you run into any issues to withdraw funds, contact me and we'll sort it out. 
A mainnet instance for integration partners is available, and a public instance will be readily available in the coming months.
